Arctic Technology empowers businesses with state-of-the-art cloud solutions and services. Our expert team delivers comprehensive and scalable cloud solutions tailored to your unique requirements. From seamless cloud migration to cost-effective resource management and top-notch security.

Arctic Technology was entrusted to architect a highly resilient and fault-tolerant cloud environment for a public sector client's Human Capital Management (HCM) platform. The goal was to ensure uninterrupted service availability and data integrity even in the face of infrastructure failures. We designed a multi-region architecture with failover servers and databases across two availability zones.

Dual Availability Zones: Arctic Technology deployed the HCM platform's resources in two geographically separate availability zones within the cloud provider's infrastructure. This provided redundancy and ensured business continuity in case of zone-specific failures.

Auto Scaling and Load Balancing: The team implemented auto-scaling and load balancing for the application servers, automatically adjusting capacity based on traffic demands. This enhanced performance and ensured even distribution of traffic across multiple server instances.

Database Replication and Failover: Arctic Technology set up database replication across the availability zones. They established a primary database in one zone and a synchronized replica in the other. In the event of a primary database failure, traffic seamlessly redirected to the replica, minimizing downtime.

Continuous Monitoring and Alerting: The project included implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems to detect any performance or availability issues promptly. Arctic Technology's monitoring tools triggered alerts, enabling the team to proactively address potential problems.

Disaster Recovery Plan: Arctic Technology devised a robust disaster recovery plan, defining procedures and actions to recover from catastrophic failures. They regularly tested the disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure their effectiveness.

The failover capabilities and redundancy across availability zones significantly reduced the risk of service disruptions and data loss. The HCM platform experienced improved uptime and performance, even during high-traffic periods or unexpected infrastructure failures. This enhanced reliability and stability fostered customer trust and satisfaction.
